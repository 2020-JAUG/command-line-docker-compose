<h1 align ="center"> Basic configurations for using docker  </h1>

 * In this repository you will find two files, one to create a dockerized environment via console commands and the other to create such environment with the help of the dokcer-compose.yml file.
    <br>


### You have a Makefile to assign the commands to use
<br>

* * This command is to raise the containers and using the -d flag for the detach mode `$ docker-compose up -d` we will use:
<br>
    -  `$ make up`
<br>

 * This command is to close our containers `$ docker-compose down` we will use:
<br>
    -  `$ make down`
